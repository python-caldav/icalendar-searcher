# icalendar-searcher

This library should contain logic for searching, filtering and sorting icalendar data, as well as logic for storing and representing an icalendar search query.

## Status as of v0.x.x

This library is full of stubbed implementations as for now.  The maintainer will urgently prioritize the bare minimum needed for refactoring the search functionality in the CalDAV library.  Version 1.0 may still contain some stubs, but should contain a relatively well-defined feature set.

## History

This is a spin-off from the python caldav project, started by Tobias Brox in 2025-11, the maintainer of the Python CalDAV client library at that time, in collaboration with the main contributors of the icalendar library.

## License

As for now I'm releasing this under the GNU Affero General Public License v.3.0.  If you find this too restrictive or if this causes license compatibility issues for you, please get in touch with me and I will consider to fix some dual licensing, like it's done with the python CalDAV library.

Any contributor has to accept that the code is released under AGPL v3.0 and at some point in the future may be dual-licensed under some more permissive license, like the EUPL v1.1.
