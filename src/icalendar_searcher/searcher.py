@dataclass
class Searcher(FilterMixin):
    """This class will:

    * Allow to build up a calendar search query.
    * Help filterering or sorting a list of calendar components

    Primarily VJOURNAL, VTODO and VEVENT Calendar components are
    intended to be supported, but we should consider if there is any
    point supporting FREEBUSY as well.

    This class is a bit stubbed as of 2025-11, many things not working
    yet.  This class was split out from the CalDAV library and is
    intended for generic search logic not related to the CalDAV
    protocol.  As of 2025-11, the first priority is to make the bare
    minimum of support needed for supporting refactorings of the
    CalDAV library.

    Long-term plan is to also allow for adding subqueries that can be
    bound together with logical AND or OR.  (Will AND every be needed?
    After all, add different criterias to one Searcher object, and all
    of them has to match)

    Properties (like SUMMARY, CATEGORIES, etc) are not meant to be
    sent through the constructor, use the :func:`icalendar_searcher.Searcher.add_property_filter`
    method.  Same goes with sort keys, they can be added through the
    `func:icalendar_searcher.Searcher.add_sort_key` method.

    The ``todo``, ``event`` and ``journal`` parameters are booleans
    for filtering the component type.  If i.e. both todo and
    journal is set to True, everything but events should be returned.
    If none is given (the default), all objects should be returned.

    If ``todo`` is given ``include_completed`` defaults to False,
    which means completed tasks will be tfiltered out.

    ``start`` and ``end`` is giving a time range.  RFC4791, section
    9.9 gives a very clear and sane definitions of what should be
    returned when searching a CalDAV calendar for contents over a time
    span.  While this package is not related to CalDAV pper se, the
    logic seems sane, so we will stick to that one.  Timestamps should
    ideally be with a time zone, if not given the local time zone will
    be assumed.  All-day events may be tricky to get correct when
    timestamps are given and calendar data covers multiple time zones.

    ``alarm_start`` and ``alarm_end`` is similar for alarm searching

    If ``expand`` is set to True, recurring objects will be expanded
    into reccurence objects for the time period specified by ``start``
    and ``end``.  Generators are used, so ``expand`` may even work
    without ``start`` and ``end`` set if care is taken
    (i.e. converting the generator to a list may cause problems)

    Unless you now what you are doing, ``expand`` should probably be
    set to true, and start and end should be given and shouldn't be
    too far away from each other.  Currently the sorting algorithm
    will blow up if the expand yields infinite number of events.  It
    may probably blow up even if expand yields millions of events.  Be
    careful.

    For filtering an icalendar instance ``mycal`` containing a
    VCALENDAR with multiple independent events, one may do
    ``searcher.filter([mycal])``.  The CalDAV library contains a
    CalDAVSearcher class inheritating this class and including a
    ``.search(caldav_calendar)`` method.  The idea is that it may be
    done in the same way also for searching other calendars or
    calendar-like systems using other protocols.

    The filtering and sorting methods should accept both wrapper
    objects (for the CalDAV library, those are called
    CalendarObjectResource and contains extra information like the URL
    and the client object) and ``icalendar.Calendar`` objects from the
    icalendar library.  Wrapper objects should have the
    ``icalendar.Calendar`` object available through a property
    ``icalendar_instance``.  Even for methods expecting a simple
    component, a ``Calendar`` should be given.  This is of
    imporantance for recurrences with exceptions (like, "daily meeting
    is held at 10:00, except today the meeting is postponed until
    12:00" may be represented through a calendar with two
    subcomponents)

    Methods expecting multiple components will always expect a list of
    calendars (CalDAV-style) - but the algorithms should also be
    robust enough to handle multiple independent components embedded
    in a single Calendar.

    Other ideas that one may consider implementing:
    * limit, offset.
    * fuzzy matching

                   Special virtual property "category" (singular) is also supported

        :param locale: Locale string (e.g., "de_DE") for locale-aware collation.
                      Only used with collation=Collation.LOCALE.

        The case_sensitive parameter only applies to text properties.
        The default has been made for case sensitive searches.  This
        is contrary to the CalDAV standard, where case insensitive
        searches are considered the default, but it's in accordance
        with the CalDAV library, where case sensitive searches has
        been the default.

        **Special handling for categories:**

        - **"categories"** (plural): Exact category name matching
          - "contains": subset check (all filter categories must be in component)
          - "==": exact set equality (same categories, order doesn't matter)
          - Commas in filter values split into multiple categories

        - **"category"** (singular): Substring matching within category names
          - "contains": substring match (e.g., "out" matches "outdoor")
          - "==": exact match to at least one category name
          - Commas in filter values treated as literal characters

        For the operator, the following is (planned to be) supported:

        * contains - will do a substring match (A search for "summary"
          "contains" "rain" will return both events with summary
          "Training session" and "Singing in the rain")

        * == - exact match is required

        * ~ - regexp match

        * <, >, <=, >= - comparision

        * <> or != - inqueality, both supported

        * def, undef - will match if the property is (not) defined.  value can be set to None, the value will be ignored.
